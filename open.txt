// Activate the github pages service first by searching through the settings
// of the repo

// The first step I did was create a html file to display info
// created a css file to style the html file

// the files are in the first directory of the repo which are chosen to be display
// when there is no html or css files the md file will be displayed

// Created a second branch called personal
// using the " git checkout -b personal " will create the branch called personal and to be connected to master
// when doing so the command will switch from main to the personal branch
// pushing the branch to master by using the " git push origin personal "
// this will enable the personal branch to be displayed within the repo online
// within the browser or repo online there should be the " compare & pull request " option
// which means to go overview of the changes which will then merge the changes to the master

// Give github a second to make the changes which will then display the different style of the output
